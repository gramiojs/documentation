# First Steps

#### What we'll do

- Create a bot account
- Install and configure the project
- Launch a bot that responds to the `/start` command
- Learn to work with environment variables and `--watch` mode

### Creating a Telegram Bot Account

First, create your bot and get a `token`. You can do this using the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) bot.

Send him the `/newbot` command and follow the instructions until you receive a token like `110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw`.

### Installation

To begin, we need to create a project and install `GramIO` using `npm`. Create a folder and run `npm init` in it to create a package.json for our project. Also specify `"type": "module"` so that the config looks something like this:

```json
{
    "name": "bot-test",
    "type": "module",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "description": ""
}
```

Next, we'll install the dependency we need - GramIO.

```bash
npm install gramio # or npm i gramio
```

### Your First Bot

Let's write the logic for our first bot. Create an `index.js` file and write:

```js
import { Bot } from "gramio";

const bot = new Bot("12345678:AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHh").command("start", (context) =>
    context.send("You sent /start")
);

bot.start();
```

where `12345678:AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHh` is your bot token.

This code can be broken down into parts:

- `import { Bot } from "gramio";` - this is an [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) of the main class of our library.
- `const bot = new Bot("12345678:AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHh")` - we create a `bot` variable and initialize the class by passing it our bot token.
- `.command("start", (context) => {...});` - We register our `/start` command handler that will be called when a user sends this command.
- `context.send("You sent /start")` - using this method we send the specified message to the same chat.
- `bot.start();` - with this we start listening for events using Long-Polling (not important for now).

Let's run this code with `node index.js` and check the bot's operation.

### What's `.send`?

This is a method of the `Message` context that allows you to send a message to the same chat where the original message came from. Thanks to this, we don't need to fully specify which chat we need to send a message to, but if needed, we can also use the regular methods from the [API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

You can send a request to the API outside of event handlers:

```js
import { Bot } from "gramio";

const bot = new Bot("12345678:AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHh");

bot.api.sendMessage({
    chat_id: "required chat id",
    text: "You sent /start",
});
```

But in handlers, you'll need to access the `context.bot` variable which is our initialized bot class:

```js
import { Bot } from "gramio";

const bot = new Bot("12345678:AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHh").command("start", (context) =>
    context.bot.api.sendMessage({
        chat_id: "required chat id",
        text: "You sent /start",
    })
);

bot.start();
```

### Bot Configuration

It's worth remembering that storing the token directly in your code is bad practice. It's recommended to store secrets in environment variables, so let's create a `.env` file in our project and move the token there:

```dotenv
BOT_TOKEN=12345678:AaBbCcDdEeFfGgHh
```

Declaring environment variables in this file is extremely simple - it's just a `key=value` pair.

Great, the file is created, but how do we access these environment variables? For this, there's the `process.env` object where these variables will be available in our program. It's worth remembering that the `.env` file exists for convenience, and not all programs read it by default. For example, in Node.js we need to specify it using the `--env-file` argument.

Let's modify our code to use environment variables:

```js
import { Bot } from "gramio";

const bot = new Bot(process.env.BOT_TOKEN).command("start", (context) =>
    context.send("You sent /start")
);

bot.start();
```

And let's run it by specifying our `.env` file ([docs](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs)):

```bash
node --env-file=.env index.js
```

Let's also add `--watch` mode, which will restart our script whenever changes are made to the file:

```bash
node --watch --env-file=.env index.js
```

For convenience, let's put this command in our `package.json`:

Add a `scripts` object and `dev` with the contents of our command. The result should look something like this:

```json
{
    "name": "bot-test",
    "type": "module",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "node --watch --env-file=.env index.js"
    },
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "description": "",
    "dependencies": {
        "gramio": "^0.0.40"
    }
}
```

Now we can run it like this: `npm run dev`

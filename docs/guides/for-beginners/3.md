# TypeScript and Keyboard Types

#### What we'll do

- Learn to run TypeScript files using TSX
- Type our `process.env`
- Get to know keyboards and their types
- Learn to respond to regular messages and inline keyboard button clicks

### Running TypeScript Files in Node.js

> Don't be afraid. We're not going to use any special TypeScript features except for type hints right now.

At the time of writing this guide, native support for running TypeScript files is just appearing in Node.js ([More details](https://t.me/kravetsone/306)), but it's too early to use it now. So we'll use the excellent "[TSX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx)" library.

First, we need to change the extension of our `index.js` file from JavaScript to TypeScript (i.e., rename it to `index.ts`). Then we can try `tsx` with a simple command:

```bash
npx tsx watch --env-file=.env index.ts
```

Pretty simple! Now let's replace the contents of the `dev` command in our `package.json` file with this command.

### Typing `process.env`

Unfortunately, TypeScript doesn't know what's in our `.env` file, so it can't provide hints. After renaming the file, you should have gotten an error when using the `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable, so let's fix this by adding to the end of the file:

```ts
declare global {
    namespace NodeJS {
        interface ProcessEnv {
            BOT_TOKEN: string;
        }
    }
}
```

Don't worry, what we did is called "declaration merging" - we merged the TypeScript interface type for `process.env` with the values we need in the global scope. For now, you can just accept it as is! The important thing is that the error has disappeared and hints are now available!

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2580
declare global {
    namespace NodeJS {
        interface ProcessEnv {
            BOT_TOKEN: string;
        }
    }
}
const process = {} as {
    env: {
        BOT_TOKEN: string;
        [key: string]: string | undefined;
    };
};
// ---cut---
process.env.B;
//           ^|
```

### Getting to Know Keyboards and Their Types

#### Keyboard

> [Section in the documentation about this keyboard type](https://gramio.dev/keyboards/keyboard)

Let's write a handler for the `/start` command and send a regular keyboard to the user:

```ts
import { Bot, Keyboard } from "gramio";

const bot = new Bot(process.env.BOT_TOKEN)
    .command("start", (context) =>
        context.send("You sent /start", {
            reply_markup: new Keyboard().text("Ping"),
        })
    )
    .hears("Ping", (context) => context.send("Pong"));

bot.start();
```

Let's understand what `new Keyboard().text("Ping")` is:

```ts
new Keyboard().text("Ping");
```

This construct written with the convenient `Keyboard` class hides behind it [some complex things](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#replykeyboardmarkup) and is actually sent to Telegram like this:

```json
{
    "keyboard": [
        [
            {
                "text": "Ping"
            }
        ]
    ],
    "one_time_keyboard": false,
    "is_persistent": false,
    "selective": false,
    "resize_keyboard": true
}
```

The `hears` method, unlike `command`, listens to all messages and checks if they match the specified text.

#### InlineKeyboard

> [Section in the documentation about this keyboard type](https://gramio.dev/keyboards/inline-keyboard)

Now let's explore the power of `InlineKeyboard`! Let's send an inline keyboard to the user along with "Pong":

```ts
import { Bot, Keyboard, InlineKeyboard } from "gramio";

const bot = new Bot(process.env.BOT_TOKEN)
    .command("start", (context) =>
        context.send("You sent /start", {
            reply_markup: new Keyboard().text("Ping"),
        })
    )
    .hears("Ping", (context) =>
        context.send("Pong", {
            reply_markup: new InlineKeyboard().text("Ping", "ping"),
        })
    );

bot.start();
```

You might wonder what the 2nd argument in the `text` function is - it's the `payload`. Essentially, it's a string that Telegram will return to us when notifying about a clicked button. Let's handle this event. It's called `callback_query` and GramIO has a convenient shorthand for it:

```ts
import { Bot, Keyboard, InlineKeyboard } from "gramio";

const bot = new Bot(process.env.BOT_TOKEN)
    .command("start", (context) =>
        context.send("You sent /start", {
            reply_markup: new Keyboard().text("Ping"),
        })
    )
    .hears("Ping", (context) =>
        context.send("Pong", {
            reply_markup: new InlineKeyboard().text("Ping", "ping"),
        })
    )
    .callbackQuery("ping", async (context) => {
        await context.answer("Pong to your forehead");

        return context.editText("Pong, but from a callback_query!");
    });

bot.start();
```
